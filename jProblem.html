                    <p>All around the world we see cities becoming more and more futuristic, we are starting to see self-driving cars, employee less stores and more. Water, electricity and sewage have already been put in pipes underground. And while all these changes are happening we see something that is not going into the 21 century. Waste is still being driven around the streets in big cars running on petrol or diesel. <br><br> Here is where the TRSH-System is an opportunity to help. With a fully automatic system to transport the waste out of the cities directly to recycling facilities, we can reduce pollution by garbage trucks in the city by 100%</p>

                    <h2>The Waste Problem in Tokyo</h2>
                    <br>
                    <p>Following a terrorist attack against Tokyo's subway system in 1995, many of the city's trash cans were removed because people feared they could be used to store terrorist weapons. To this day, the city still has few trash cans, which makes it difficult for people to dispose of trash. <br><br> Tokyo's garbage collection system is also strict and can vary within the city's wards, making it more difficult than it needs to be. Creating one common solution for Tokyo will make the system more effective and less confusing. <br><br> Our solution could give Tokyo's citizens the freedom to dispose of their trash whenever they want, instead of having to wait for their scheduled trash collection day. With today's system, it can be months between collection days for certain waste, which means that people have to store their trash for long periods, often inside tiny apartments.</p>
